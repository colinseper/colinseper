  <h3> About Me </h3> I am a sophmore studying Computer Science at Saint Louis University in hopes to become a full-stack software engineer. Other than programming I like to play chess ♟️, workout 🏋️, play baskeball 🏀 and listen to music 🎼. 
  <h4>Languages I've Used 👨‍💻</h4>
    C ● Python ● JavaScript ● R ● MATLAB 
  <h4>Web and Database</h4>
    HTML ● CSS ● SQL(sqlite)
  <h4>Frameworks</h4>
    Bootstrap ● Flask 
  <h4>Coding Journey</h4> Below I plan to list all the coding courses I've taken, projects I've worked on and basically everything I did (including college courses) until I become a full-stack software engineer, just in case anyone wants course recommendations or ideas on classes to take and at what point.
  <br><br> ● <a href ="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Harvard CS50x</a>(C): No prior programming experience, difficult but helped me immensely both as an introduction to programming and as a confirmation of wanting to become a software engineer. Great course for anyone who has no prior background and wants to learn a bit about learning to code.
