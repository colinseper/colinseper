  <h3> About Me👨‍💻</h3> I am a sophmore studying Computer Science at Saint Louis University in hopes to become a full-stack software engineer. Other than programming I like to play chess ♟️, workout 🏋️, play baskeball 🏀 and listen to music 🎼. 
  <h4>Languages</h4>
    C, Python, Java, JavaScript, R, MATLAB
  <h4>Web and Database</h4>
    HTML, CSS, SQL (MySQL and SQLite)
  <h4>Frameworks</h4>
    Bootsrap, Flask, JavaSwing
  <h3>Coding Journey 🧗</h3> Below I plan to list all the coding courses I've taken, projects I've completed, and basically everything I did (including college courses) until I become a full-stack software engineer, just in case anyone wants course recommendations or ideas on classes to take and at what point. Most of the resources I use will be free, but inevitably some courses cannot be avaible online (college classes) or I may spend money on a course if I feel it is worth it. I will give a nod to projects I completed here, but descriptions/code will be in one of my repositories.
  <br><br> ● <a href ="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Harvard CS50x</a>(C): No prior programming experience, difficult but helped me immensely both as an introduction to programming and as a confirmation of wanting to become a software engineer. Great course for anyone who has no prior background and wants to learn a bit about learning to code. Created a full-stack webpage for my final project (CS50_Final_Project Repository).
  <br><br> ● Intro to Programming with MATLAB(C - College): Review of general principles and introduction to MATLAB language. Created Snake game for final project, viewable in repositories(Intro_to_MATLAB_Final_Project).
  <br><br> ● Statistics with R(C - College): Basic introduction to R and Statistics.
  <br><br> ● <a href ="https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-java-from-scratch" target ="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn Java from Scratch</a>(C): Fairly good intro to Java course, although at some points found it hard to follow (Used Youtube Videos from BroCode to help my understanding). Make sure to follow along coding either with VScode or another resource. At later points the given code solutions were a bit cruddy, with some being solutions soley to solve the test cases rather than the problems asked (always try and find a better solution!). However, overall good intro course and great free resource.
<br><br> ● Introduction to Object Oriented Programming with Python(IP - College):
<br><br> ● <a href= "https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1"> Algorithms I</a>(IP):
  <br><br> <a href ="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>
  <br> ● Fundamentals(IP):
  <br> ● Full-Stack JavaScript:
